    <h1 class="articletitle">CSN money will be doubled</h1>
    <div class="articletext">
    <p class="p1"> The government has recently announced that CSN money will be doubled for all students in the country as of January 28th. </p>

    <p class="p1">The reason for this has been revealed to be for extra incentive for students to study more and obtain higher grades than before. The money will motivate students to work harder and even allow them to purchase better equipment for school.</p>
  
    <p class="p1">The effects are predicted to be massively positive towards the average accomplishment level for all students around the country. Earning 2500 kr per month instead of the previously 1250 will make students more excited for school and increase morale. </p>

    <img class="moneyimage" src="../Images/money2.jpg" alt="Money">
    <p class="p1">According to our own investigative team though, the effects wont be as big as the government thinks it will be. The reason for this is that CSN eligibility is based on the amount of hours you've been in school. This means that a student can perform the exact same as they did before, for more money. There is no incentive to work harder </p>
